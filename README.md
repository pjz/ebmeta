# ebmeta - an ebook metadata reader/writer CLI

Currently only works on .epubs via [EBookLib](https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib/) ; PRs welcome!

Written as a lighter-weight alternative to installing all of calibre just to get their metadata tools.

## Installation:

`pip install ebmeta`

## Usage:

`ebmeta --help`
